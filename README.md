# generative_ai_notebook
A notebook to store generative AI chats, grouped into categorical folders.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Running the Project

To run this project, ensure you have Flutter installed on your system. Then, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch the application on your default device or emulator.

### Building the Project

To build a release version of your app, run:

```bash
flutter build apk
```

This command generates an APK for Android devices. For iOS, use `flutter build ios` instead, ensuring you have a valid development environment set up for iOS development.

### App Functionality

The app allows users to store and categorize their generative AI chats. Users can create folders for different categories and add their chats to these folders. The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to start organizing their AI-generated content.

## Using the Devcontainer

To streamline the development process and ensure a consistent environment for all contributors, this project supports development within a Devcontainer using GitHub Codespaces or VSCode with the Remote-Containers extension.

### Getting Started with the Devcontainer

1. If using VSCode, ensure you have the Remote-Containers extension installed.
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...".
3. Choose the project folder to start the development environment.

For GitHub Codespaces:
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository page.
2. Click the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
3. Follow the prompts to create a new codespace.

### Testing the Configuration Locally

To test the Devcontainer configuration locally in VSCode:
1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container".
3. Test the development environment by running the application or executing other tasks.

### Limitations

While the Devcontainer aims to provide a comprehensive development environment, there may be slight differences compared to a local setup. If you encounter any issues or limitations, please report them in the project's issue tracker.
